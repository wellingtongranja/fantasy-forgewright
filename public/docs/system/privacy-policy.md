# Privacy Policy

**Fantasy Editor**  
**Version 0.0.2 (Alpha)**  
**Last Updated**: January 2025

## Our Commitment

At Forgewright, Inc., we take your privacy seriously. Fantasy Editor is designed with privacy-first principles, storing your documents locally on your device.

## Information We Collect

### 1. Local Data (Stored on Your Device)

Fantasy Editor stores the following data locally in your browser:
- Documents you create and edit
- Editor preferences (theme, font size, width)
- Recent document history
- Tags and metadata
- GitHub authentication tokens (if you use GitHub sync)

**This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to sync with GitHub.**

### 2. GitHub Integration (Optional)

If you choose to use GitHub integration:
- We use GitHub OAuth for authentication
- Your documents sync directly between your browser and GitHub
- We do not store your GitHub credentials
- We do not have access to your GitHub repositories

### 3. Analytics (Anonymous)

During the alpha period, we may collect:
- Anonymous usage statistics
- Feature usage patterns
- Error reports
- Performance metrics

**We NEVER collect:**
- Personal information
- Document contents
- Email addresses (unless you contact us)
- IP addresses
- Location data

## How We Use Information

We use collected information solely to:
- Improve the Software's functionality
- Fix bugs and enhance performance
- Understand feature usage
- Provide customer support (when you contact us)

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
- All documents are stored using browser IndexedDB
- Data is isolated to your browser profile
- Clearing browser data will delete local documents

### Security Measures
- All GitHub communications use HTTPS
- OAuth tokens are stored securely in browser storage
- No passwords are ever stored by the application

## Third-Party Services

### GitHub
If you use GitHub integration, your data is subject to [GitHub's Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

### Future Integrations
We will update this policy before adding any new third-party integrations.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Access all data stored locally (it's in your browser)
- Delete all data (clear browser storage)
- Export your documents at any time
- Opt-out of GitHub sync
