## Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### 0. Definitions

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

### 1. Source Code

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

### 2. Basic Permissions

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.

### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996.

### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice.

### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4.

### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source.

### 7. Additional Terms

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.

### 8. Termination

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.

### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.

### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors.

### 11. Patents

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims.

### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom

If conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.

### 13. Remote Network Interaction

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version.

### 14. Revised Versions of this License

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.

### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

### 16. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES.

### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability.
